ðŸš— Line Following Robot using Arduino
This project is a simple yet powerful line following robot built using an Arduino UNO, IR sensors, and a motor driver module. The robot can autonomously follow a black line on a white surface, making it ideal for beginners in robotics, automation, and embedded systems.


ðŸ“Œ Features

Follows black lines using IR sensors.

Real-time line detection and correction.

Basic movement logic: forward, left, right, stop.

Modular and easy-to-understand Arduino code.

Expandable with PID control, junction detection, and maze solving.



ðŸ§° Components Used

Arduino Uno.

L298N Motor Driver.

BO-type DC Motors (x2).

IR Sensor Modules (x2).

Robot Chassis Kit.

12V Battery Pack.

Jumper Wires & Caster Wheel.



ðŸ§  How It Works
IR sensors detect the black line and send signals to the Arduino. Based on sensor inputs, the robot decides whether to move straight, turn left, or turn right. The motor driver then executes the movement by controlling the motors.


ðŸ”­ Future Improvements

Add PID control for smoother turns

Integrate color or ultrasonic sensors

Maze solving and path memory

Bluetooth/WiFi control
